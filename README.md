It's a web layout generation and optimization system based on athestic evaluation. Four kinds of features about visual complexity were extracted using image processing. Users' scores for 700 webpages were collected for supervised learning in Matlab. And a genetic learning algorithm was used to generate webpage design.
* extractor: feature extractor
* matlab: drawing experiment diagram and evaluator
* spider: spider for webpage
* standardization series：label data
* standardization_and_judger：quick sort
* standarzation.heap: heap sort
* standardzation.old：binary standardizatioon
* baidu_seo：rank the website using aesthetic score in Baidu search
